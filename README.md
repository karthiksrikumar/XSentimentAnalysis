# XSentimentAnalysis

This project involves performing sentiment analysis on X data using machine learning models. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on their text content.

## Project Overview

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and involves the following key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the Twitter data for analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Transforming text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF or Word Embeddings.
3. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models to classify the sentiment of tweets.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize the distribution of sentiments across the dataset.
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the models using various performance metrics.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
